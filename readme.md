## About Astro

Astro is a (highly in progress) issue tracking/project web application based on [Laravel](https://laravel.com). It aims to follow best practises and enable productive handling and managing of issues, while also giving administrators and users as much customization as possible to make the tool suit their needs.

## State

Astro is still quite new and far from being able to be used in a production environment.

## License

Astro is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
